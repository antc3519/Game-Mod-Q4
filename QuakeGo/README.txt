Welcome to QuakeGo! This is a mod that replicates Counter Strike in multiplayer mode, 
specifically team deathmatch.  This mod introduces custom CS:GO weapons, a shop between rounds, 
tactical objectives, utilities, and perks. Besides objectives like bomb points, 
the game is more or less the same so have fun! 

The weapons have been altered a bit, and there are special perks available as well as a money system
where you get money for killing enemies to spend in the shop. To open the shop press B and each item
has a corresponding button bound to it.

Railgun = AWP
Machine Gun = AK47
Blaster = special Desert Eagle :)
Gauntlet = knife
Shotgun = Nova
